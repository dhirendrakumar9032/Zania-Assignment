# Project: Card Container with Image Overlay[link][https://zania-assignment-chi.vercel.app/]

**My Name is Dhirendra Kumar, I am a frontend developer.** I created this project to show cards that users can move around and click to see bigger images.

## What This Project Does

This project lets you see a list of cards on the screen. You can do a few things with these cards:

1. **Move Cards Around**: You can drag any card and drop it in a new place to rearrange the order.
2. **Click on Cards**: When you click on a card, it shows a bigger picture of that card in the middle of the screen.
3. **Close the Big Picture**: You can click on the big picture or press the "Escape" key on your keyboard or click on image to close it and go back to the list of cards.

## How It Works

When you open the project, it first shows you that it's loading the cards. Once it's done loading, you can start moving cards or clicking on them to see bigger pictures.


### Special Parts of the Project

- **Cards List**: This part takes care of showing all the cards and lets you move them or click on them.
- **Big Picture View**: When you click a card, this part shows the picture in full screen. You can close it by clicking on it or by pressing the "Escape" key.

## How to Use This Project

If you want to try this project on your computer, here are the steps:

1. Get the project files on your computer.
2. Open the folder with the project and run `npm install` to set things up.
3. Then run `npm start` to start the project.

Now, you can see the project in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Tools I Used

- **React**: This helps me make the parts of the project work together smoothly.
- **TypeScript**: This makes sure that the parts of the project can understand each other without mistakes.
- **CSS**: This makes everything look nice.
